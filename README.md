This Python code defines two variables a and b with the values 9 each. Then, it performs various arithmetic operations using these variables and prints out the results along with a description of the operation being performed.

Here's a breakdown of each operation:

Addition: a + b
Subtraction: a - b
Multiplication: a * b
Division: a / b
Exponentiation: a ** b (raising a to the power of b)
Floor Division: a // b (division that rounds down to the nearest integer)
Modulus: a % b (remainder of the division of a by b)
Each print statement displays the expression being evaluated along with its result.

So, when you run this code, you'll see the results of these arithmetic operations printed out.
